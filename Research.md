The numerical values that you need are: B → the magnetic field strength, which is a variable, pending the flux (PHI); A → the surface area of the iron piece; e → the electron charge; N → the number of charges present (a product of Avogadro’s Number), and v → the average velocity of electrons in each domain.

FM = Q v B where Q = N e.
